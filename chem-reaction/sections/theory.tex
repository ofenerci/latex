\section{Theory}

Consider a batch reactor hosting a first-order-kinetics chemical reaction of the form $\ce{R ->[\kchrcoeff] P}$, where \ce R represents the reactant and \ce P the product and $\kchrcoeff$ the reaction kinetic coefficient, $\dim\kchrcoeff = 1/\phdim{T}$.

Let $t$ represent the chemical reaction duration, $\dim t = \phdim T$, let $\sconc r = \sconc r\vat t$ be \ce{R} molar concentration and let $\sconc p = \sconc p\vat t$ be \ce{P} molar concentration, $\dim\sconc r = \dim\sconc p = \phdim N/\phdim L^3$. Consider $\sconc r\txt i$ to be the reactant concentration when $t = 0$. Then, model the reaction kinetics by applying the mass conservation principle to the reactor:
\beq
\rate{\sconc r} = -\kchrcoeff\sconc r\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\sconc r\vat 0 = \sconc r\txt i\,,
\eeq
where $\rate{\sconc r}$ represents the reactant accumulation rate, $\dim\rate{\sconc r} = \phdim N/\phdim T\phdim L^3$.

To find the reactant concentration, solve the differential equation by separating variables and applying the initial condition to have
\beq
\sconc r = \sconc r\txt i\exp\vat{-\kchrcoeff t}\,.
\eeq
 
Choose the set $\elset{\phdim{N}, \phdim{L},\phdim{T}}$ as a dimensional system. Then, non-dimensionalize the model by applying the transformations
\beq
\sconc r\txt i\,\kdim_{\sconc r} = \sconc r\,,\qquad
\sconc r\txt i\,\kdim_{\sconc p} = \sconc p\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\kdim_t = \kchrcoeff t\,,
\eeq
which yields
\beq
\kdim_{\sconc r} = \exp\vat{-\kdim_t}\,.
\eeq

Next, to calculate the product concentration, apply the stoichiometric~\footnote{~In dimensional form, the stoichiometric condition is $\sconc r + \sconc p = \sconc{r\txt i}$.} condition $\kdim_{\sconc r} + \kdim_{\sconc p} = 1$:
\beq
\kdim_{\sconc p} = 1 - \exp\vat{-\kdim_t}\,.
\eeq

Now, compute the half-life time, $\kdim_{t=0.5}$, defined as the time at which the product concentration equals the half of the reactant concentration:
\beq
\kdim_{t=0.5} = \ln\vat 2\,.
\eeq

Finally, find the 99.99\%-life time, $\kdim_{t=0.9999}$: the time at which the product concentration equals 99.99\% of the reactant concentration:
\beq
%\lifetime{0.9999} = -\dfrac{\ln\vat{1 - 0.9999}}{\kchrcoeff}
%                  = -\dfrac{\ln\vat{0.0001}}{\kchrcoeff}
%                  = \dfrac{\ln\vat{10000}}{\kchrcoeff}\,.\mqed
\kdim_{t=0.9999} = -\ln\vat{1 - 0.9999} = \ln\vat{10000}\,.\mqed
\eeq
