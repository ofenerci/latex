\docepigraph{The laws of physics must all be expressible as geometric (coordinate-independent and reference-frame-independent) relationships between geometric objects, which represent physical entities.}

\docepigraph{The idea of dimensional analysis is that units [...] are artificial. The universe cares not for our choice of units. Valid physical laws must have the same form in any system of units. Only dimensionless quantities -- pure numbers -- are the same in every unit system, so we write equations in a universe-friendly, dimensionless form. Often, there is only one such form. Then, without doing any work, we have solved the problem.}

\docepigraph{We believe that technology is at its very best and it's more empowering when it simply disappears.}
{Ives}{[we believe the same about mathematics.]}

\docepigraph{In almost every quantitative problem, the analysis simplifies when you follow the proverbial advice of doing first things first. First approximate and understand the most important effect -- the big part -- then refine your analysis and understanding. This procedure of successive approximation or \scare{taking out the big part} generates meaningful, memorable, and usable expressions.}{Mahajan}{\citep[p. 77]{sanjoy:2010}}
