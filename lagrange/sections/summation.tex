\section{Summation convention}
Traditionally, a vector $v$ in three dimensional space, $\nespace 3$, is written as
\beq
v = v_1\hat x + v_2\hat y + v_3\hat z\,,
\eeq
where $\elset{v_1, v_2, v_3}$ are the components of $v$ and $\elset{\hat x, \hat y, \hat z}$ the unit vectors pointing in the direction of the Cartesian axes.
