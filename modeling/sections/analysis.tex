\section{Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Non-dimensionalize
\item Analogies with other related problems
\item Use analytic and numeric methods to obtain solutions/results.
\end{itemize}

In the case of analytic solutions, verify that they satisfy the model equations.

Verify assumptions, uncertainty analysis.
