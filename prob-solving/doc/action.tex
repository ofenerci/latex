\docepigraph{Too much mathematical rigor teaches \lingform{rigor mortis}: the fear of making an unjustified leap even when it lands on a correct result. Instead of paralysis, have courage -- shoot first and ask questions later. Although unwise as public policy, it is a valuable problem-solving philosophy.}{Mahajan}{\cite[p. viii]{sanjoy:2010}}
