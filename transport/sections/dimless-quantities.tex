\section{Dimensionless Quantities}
Dimensionless groups can be classified into three broad categories: the dimensionless fluxes, the ratios of convection and diffusion and the ratios of different types of diffusion. Before proceeding to define dimensionless quantities, we first define the diffusion coefficients for mass, momentum and energy, in order to provide a definite basis for the discussion. Here, we restrict ourselves to the macroscopic definition.


\subsection{Mass, momentum and energy diffusivities}
The fundamental constitutive relations~\footnote{~A constitutive relation is a relation between two physical quantities (especially kinetic quantities as related to kinematic quantities) that is specific to a material or substance, and approximates the response of that material to external stimuli, usually as applied fields or forces. They are combined with other equations governing physical laws to solve physical problems; \eg, in fluid mechanics the fluid flow in a pipe, in solid state physics the response of a crystal to an electric field or, in structural analysis, the connection between applied stresses or forces to strains or deformations. 

Some constitutive equations are simply phenomenological; others are derived from first principles. A common approximate constitutive equation frequently is expressed as a simple proportionality using a parameter taken to be a property of the material, such as electrical conductivity or a spring constant. However, it is often necessary to account for the directional dependence of the material, and the scalar parameter is generalized to a tensor. Constitutive relations are also modified to account for the rate of response of materials and their non-linear behavior.} in transport processes are the Fick's law for mass diffusion, Fourier's law for heat conduction and Newton's law for viscosity. The respective diffusion coefficients can be defined as follows.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item When there is a concentration difference maintained across a slab of fluid, then there is transfer of mass from the surface at higher concentration to the surface at lower concentration. The mass flux (mass per unit area per unit time) is inversely proportional to the length and directly proportional to the difference in concentration or temperature across the material. If a concentration difference $\Dx\conc$, $\dim\conc = \phdim M/\phdim L^3$, is maintained between two ends of a slab of length $\length$, the mass flux $\flux\mass$, $\dim\flux\mass = \phdim M/\phdim L^2\phdim T$, is given by Fick's law:
\beq
\flux\mass = -\kdiff \dfrac{\Dx\conc}{\length}\,,
\eeq
where $\kdiff$ is the diffusivity, $\dim\kdiff = \phdim L^2/\phdim T$.
Here, the negative sign indicates that mass is transferred from the region of higher concentration to the region of lower concentration.
%
\item For the transport of thermal energy, the energy flux is related to the temperature difference by Fourier's law. For a slab of material of length $\length$ with a temperature difference $\Dx\temp$ across the material, the energy flux $\flux\then$ is given by
\beq
\flux\then = -\kthcond\dfrac{\Dx\temp}{\length}\,,
\eeq
where $\kthcond$ is the thermal conductivity, $\dim\kthcond = \phdim E/\phdim L\phdim T\phdimtemp$, and the negative sign indicates that thermal energy is transferred from the region of higher to the region of lower temperature.
%
\item The Newton's law of viscosity relates the shear stress $\shear$ (force per unit area at the wall) to the strain rate (change in velocity per unit length across the flow) for the simple shear flow of a fluid as shown in figure 1.1.2.
\beq
\shear_{xy} = \kinvis\dfrac{\Dx\vel_x}{\length}.
\eeq
Note that there is no negative sign in Newton's law, in contrast to Fick's law and Fourier's law. This is due to the difference in convention with regard to the definition of stress in fluid mechanics and the definition of fluxes in transport phenomena. The shear stress $\shear_{xy}$ in Newton's law is defined as the force per unit area at a surface in the $x$ direction whose outward unit normal is in the $y$ direction. In contrast, the fluxes are defined as positive if they are directed into the volume. Therefore, the shear stress is actually the negative of the momentum flux. If the stress is defined to the the force per unit area acting at a surface whose inward unit normal is in the $x$ direction, then this would introduce a negative sign in Newton's equation. However, it is conventional in fluid mechanics to define the stress with reference to the outward unit normal to the surface. As we will see later, this difference in convention will not affect the balance equations that are finally obtained for the rate of change of momentum.

In this course, we will adopt the convention of defining the stress $\shear_{xy}$ as the force per unit area in the $x$ direction acting along a surface whose outward unit normal is in the $y$ direction and use the last equation for Newton's law of viscosity.
\end{itemize}

The diffusion coefficients are the proportionality constants in the relationship between the flux of a quantity (mass, thermal energy, momentum) and the driving force. The flux of a quantity (mass, thermal energy, momentum) is the amount of that quantity transferred per unit area per unit time. The driving force for a quantity (mass, thermal energy, momentum) is the gradient (change per unit distance) in the density (quantity per unit volume) of that quantity. So the transport equations can be written in the general form
\beq
\begin{pmatrix}
\text{transport of quantity} \\
\text{per unit area} \\
\text{per unit time}
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\text{diffusion} \\
\text{coefficient}
\end{pmatrix}
\dfrac{
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \text{change in density (per unit volume)} \\
    \text{of the quantity} \\
    \text{across the material}
    \end{pmatrix}
    }
    {\text{thickness of the material}}
\eeq
From dimensional analysis of the above equation, see that the diffusion coefficients of all quantities have dimensions of $\phdim L^2/T$. These diffusion coefficients are defined from Fick's law, Fourier's law and Newton's law as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\item From Fick's law, the diffusion coefficient $\kdiff$ is the ratio of mass flux (mass transported per unit area per unit time) and the gradient in the concentration (mass per unit volume). Therefore, the mass diffusivity is just the diffusion coefficient $\kdiff$.

\item It is possible, on the other hand, to define a diffusion coefficient for thermal transfer as follows. The difference in temperature $\Dx\temp$ can be expressed in terms of the difference in the energy density between the two sides as $\Dx\temp = \Dx\thendens/\dens\kshcap_\vol$, where $\Dx\thendens$ is the thermal energy density (thermal energy per unit volume, $\dim\thendens = \phdim E/\phdim L^3$) and $\kshcap_\vol$ the specific thermal capacity, $\dim\kshcap_\vol = \phdim L^2/\phdim T^2\phdimtemp$. With this, the equation for the thermal flux can be written as
\beq
\flux\then = \dfrac{\kthcond}{\dens\kshcap_\vol}\dfrac{\Dx\thendens}{\length}\,.
\eeq
Note that the above equation has the same form as the mass flux equation, with a thermal diffusivity $\kdiff_h = \kthcond/\dens\kshcap_\vol$, $\dim\kdiff_h = \phdim L^2/\phdim T$.

\item The \lingo{momentum diffusivity} is the relation between the momentum flux (rate of momentum transport per unit area per unit time) and the difference in the momentum density (momentum per unit volume). Consider the layer of fluid shown in figure 1.1.2. Since the momentum of a fluid parcel is the mass of that parcel multiplied by its velocity, the momentum density is the product of the mass density $\dens$ and velocity $\vel_x$. Therefore, the equation for the flux, expressed in terms of the momentum density, is
\beq
\shear_{xy} = \kinvis\dfrac{\Dx(\dens\vel_x)}{\length}\,,
\eeq
where $\kinvis$ is the momentum diffusivity. For an incompressible fluid with constant density, the momentum diffusivity is $\kinvis = \dynvis/\dens$. The momentum diffusivity, $\kinvis$, with $\dim\kinvis = \phdim L^2/\phdim T$, is also referred to as the \lingo{kinematic viscosity}.
\end{enumerate}

Summarizing:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item mass transport: $\flux\mass = -\kdiff\grad\conc$, where mass flux $\dim\flux\mass = \phdim M/\phdim L^2\phdim T$, mass diffusion coefficient $\dim\kdiff = \phdim L^2/\phdim T$ and concentration gradient $\dim\grad\conc = \phdim M/L^4$.
%
\item thermal energy transport: $\flux\then = -\kthcond/\dens\kshcap\grad\thendens$, where thermal energy flux $\dim\flux\then = \phdim E/\phdim L^2\phdim T$, thermal conductivity $\dim\kthcond = \phdim E/\phdim L\phdim T\phdimtemp$, mass density $\dim\dens = \phdim E\phdim T^2/\phdim L^5$, specific thermal capacity $\dim\kshcap = \phdim L^2/\phdim T^2\phdimtemp$ and energy density gradient $\dim\grad\thendens = \phdim E/\phdim L^4$.
%
\item momentum transport: $\shear = \kinvis\grad\dens\vel = \dynvis/\dens\grad\dens\vel$, where shear stress $\dim\shear = \phdim F/\phdim L^2$, kinematic viscosity $\dim\kinvis = \dynvis/\dens = \phdim L^2/\phdim T$, mass density $\dim\dens = \phdim F\phdim T^2/\phdim L^4$, velocity $\dim\vel = \phdim L/\phdim T$.

\subsection{Wording}
In the present document, the adjective \lingo{density} is used to express a quantity divided by volume; \eg, energy density, $\dim\thendens = \phdim E/\phdim L^3$, and  the adjective \lingo{specific} to express a quantity divided by mass; \eg, specific thermal capacity, $\dim\kshcap_\vol = \phdim L^2/\phdim T^2\phdimtemp$.


\subsection{Ratio of convection and diffusion}
Convective transport takes place due to the mean flow of a fluid, even in the absence of a concentration difference. For example, if a fluid with concentration $\conc$ travels with velocity $\vel$ in a pipe, then the total amount of mass transported per unit time is $\conc\vel\area_p$, where $\area_p$ is the cross-sectional area of the tube. Therefore, the flux (mass transported by the fluid, per unit area perpendicular to the flow per unit time) is $\conc\vel$. Consequently, the ratio between the rate of transport due to convective and diffusive effects is $\vel\length/\kdiff$, where $\length$ is the length scale across which there is a change in the density of this quantity.

The dimensionless numbers which are ratios of convective and diffusive transport rates, see\cref{tab:rationofdiffusivities}: 
%
\begin{itemize}
\item the Reynolds number, $\kreynolds = \dens\vel\length/\dynvis = \vel\length/\kinvis$, the ratio of momentum convection and diffusion,

\item the Peclet number for mass transfer, $\kpeclet = \vel\length/\kdiff$, the ratio of mass convection and diffusion, and

\item the Peclet number for thermal transfer, $\kpeclet = \vel\length/\kdiff_h = \dens\kshcap_\press\vel\length/\kthcond$, where $\kshcap_\press$ is the specific thermal capacity at constant pressure.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Dimensionless numbers in natural convection}
In natural convection, the driving force for convection is the body force caused by a variation in the density of the fluid, which is in turn caused by variation in temperature. In contrast to natural convection, the characteristic flow velocity is not known \apriori, but has to be determined from the driving force due to the density difference. If we assume there is a balance between the driving force and the viscous stresses in the fluid, dimensional analysis can be used to infer that the characteristic velocity should scale as $\chpq\vel\approx\force\diam/\dynvis$, where $\force$ is the driving force for convection per unit volume of fluid, $\diam$ is the diameter of the body or the characteristic length and $\dynvis$ is the dynamic viscosity.

The driving force for convection, per unit volume of the fluid, is proportional to the product of the density variation $\Dx\dens$ and the acceleration due to gravity $\grav$. The density variation is is proportional to $\dens\kthexp\Dx\temp$, where $\Dx\temp$ is the variation in temperature and $\kthexp$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion. Therefore, the force per unit area is proportional to $\dens\grav\kthexp\Dx\temp$. With this, the characteristic velocity for the flow is $\chpq\vel\approx\dens\diam^2\grav\kthexp\Dx\temp/\dynvis$. The \lingo{Grashof number} is the Reynolds number based upon this convection velocity,
\beq
\kgrashof = \dfrac{\dens\chpq\vel\diam}{\dynvis} 
          = \dfrac{\dens^2\diam^3\grav\kthexp\Dx\temp}{\dynvis^2}\,.
\eeq

In defining the Grashof number, we used the momentum diffusivity and the body force to obtain the characteristic velocity scale. An alternative definition is the \lingo{Rayleigh number}, where the thermal diffusivity, $\kthcond/\dens\kshcap_\press$, is used to determine the characteristic velocity. The characteristic velocity is then given by $\chpq\vel\approx\force\diam^2\kshcap_\press/\kthcond$, where $\force = \dens\kthexp\Dx\temp$ is the driving force for convection per unit volume of fluid. The Reynolds number based on this convection velocity and momentum diffusivity is the Rayleigh number,
\beq
\krayleigh = \dfrac{\dens^2\kshcap_\press\diam^3\grav\kthexp\Dx\temp}{\dynvis\kthcond}\,.
\eeq
The \lingo{Rayleigh-Benard} instability of a fluid layer heated from below occurs when the Rayleigh number increases beyond a critical value.


\subsection{Other dimensionless groups}
There are two important dimensionless groups involving surface tension, which are the \lingo{Weber number} and the \lingo{capillary number}. The Weber number is the ratio of inertial and surface tension forces,
\beq
\kweber = \dfrac{\dens\vel^2\length}{\surftens}\,,
\eeq
while the capillary number is the ratio of viscous and surface tension forces,
\beq
\kcapillar = \dfrac{\dynvis\vel}{\surftens}\,,
\eeq
where $\surftens$ is the surface tension, $\dim\surftens = \phdim F/\phdim L$.

In problems involving free interfaces, if the Reynolds number is low, inertial forces are negligible compared to viscous forces, and the capillary number has to be determined in order to assess the ratio of viscous and surface tension forces. At high Reynolds number, it is appropriate to determine the Weber number in order to examine the ratio of inertial and surface tension forces. In addition to the Weber and capillary numbers, the \lingo{Bond number} is a dimensionless group appropriate for situations where a free interface is under the influence of a gravitational field. This dimensionless group is defined as the ratio of gravitational and surface tension forces,
\beq
\kbond = \dfrac{\dens\grav\length^2}{\surftens}\,.
\eeq


\subsection{Dimensionless groups involving gravity}
The ratio of inertial and gravitational forces is given by the \lingo{Froud number},
\beq
\kfroud = \dfrac{\vel^2}{\grav\length}\,,
\eeq
In applications involving rotation of fluids, the Froud number is also the ratio of centrifugal and gravitational forces.


\subsection{Summary}
From the magnitudes of dimensionless quantities, one can immediately infer which effects are dominant and which are negligible. For instance, if the Reynolds number is small, then inertial effects are small compared to viscous effects. Thus, the effect of inertia can be neglected and fluid density is no longer an important parameter. However, it should be noted that though convective effects can be neglected with the Reynolds number or Peclet number is small, diffusive effects can not always be neglected even when these numbers are large, for reasons to do with the formation of momentum or thermal boundary layers near surfaces where these effects become important.
